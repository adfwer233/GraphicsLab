# GraphicsLab Documentation

GraphicsLab is my codebase for computer graphics and geometric modeling research. GraphicsLab has following modules:


- **Rendering**: A tiny rendering engine `vkl` based on vulkan.
- **Geometry Kernel**: A tiny geometry kernel for mesh, point cloud and boundary representation.

GraphicsLab can be used to create prototypes for graphics applications.
